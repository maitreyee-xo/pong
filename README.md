# ProjectTitle

The following four files contain the code to the famous arcade game: PONG
I have created one main class which inherits classes from the rest of the three python files. the entire game is built using the concept of OOP (object oriented programming) and using python turtle.

## Rules


- The right slider's upward and downward movements will be controlled using 'q' and 'w' keys (NOTE: BOTH KEYS SHOULD BE IN LOWERCASE) respectively.
- The left slider's upward and downward movements will be controlled using 'a' and 's' keys  (NOTE: BOTH KEYS SHOULD BE IN LOWERCASE) respectively.
- If any one of the sliders doesn't manage to hit the ball in time, the ball returns to it's original position (0, 0) and the opponent gets a point.
